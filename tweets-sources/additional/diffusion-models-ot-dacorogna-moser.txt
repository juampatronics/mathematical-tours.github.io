Optimal transport, convolution and averaging define interpolations between probability distributions. One can find vector fields advecting particles that matches these interpolations. They are the Benamou-Brenier, flow-matching and Dacorogna-Moser fields. [NB: for Dacorogna-Moser the field is singular bc of the abrupt change of support in the cat-donut example]
