There are two ways to differentiate a function over the space of measures: vertically (Euclidean) and horizontally (Wasserstein). These correspond to locally modifying the mass amplitude and positions, respectively. The Wasserstein derivative is the usual (pointwise) gradient of the Euclidean derivative.

Wasserstein gradient flows optimize a function over the space of probability distributions by displacing the mass horizontally according to the Wasserstein gradient. This process can equivalently be viewed as an L^2 flow when "overparameterizing" the function by pushforward deformations of some reference measure.

While this equivalence between Wasserstein and L^2 flows might have been known to the ancient Greeks, the first explicit reference I am aware of is in the (unpublished) lecture notes of Pierre-Louis Lions on mean field games, written down by Pierre Cardaliaguet (Section 6.1). https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cardaliaguet/MFG20130420.pdf
