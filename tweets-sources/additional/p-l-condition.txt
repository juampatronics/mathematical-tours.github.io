The Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz inequality is known to imply the linear convergence of function values. This great paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04636 provides extensive details and connections to other inequalities. However, what seems to be less well-known is that it also implies the linear convergence of the iterates themselves. This was explained to me by @Raphael, and the proof is adapted from https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03129.
