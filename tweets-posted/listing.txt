In some cases (e.g. Gaussian and polyharmonic), corresponds to regression in a reproducing Hilbert space. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function

696-corner-detect.png
Oldies but goldies: Chris Harris, Mike Stephens, A combined corner and edge detector, 1988. The most frequently used corner detector, based on the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Corner_Detector

697-proj-fw.m4v
Projected gradient and Frank-Wolfe are the cornerstones of constrained optimization. PG typically evolves on the boundary while FW operates as an interior point method. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm

698-sinkhorn.m4v
Oldies but goldies: Richard Sinkhorn, A relationship between arbitrary positive matrices and doubly stochastic matrices, 1964. The first proof of the convergence of the diagonal scaling algorithm (aka IPFP, RAS, etc) toward a uniquely defined bistochastic matrix. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinkhorn%27s_theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_proportional_fitting

Gradient descent on particles’ positions (Lagrangian) is equivalent to an advection linear PDE on the density of particles (Eulerian). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field

700-bicubic.m4v
Oldies but goldies: R. Keys, Cubic convolution interpolation for digital image processing, 1980. Introduces bicubic interpolation, the most frequently used image interpolation method. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation
